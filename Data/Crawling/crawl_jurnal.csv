0,Stephanie Zhang,3 months ago,5 stars,"Amazing palace.

I visited the palace in Feb 2020, and I still remember it until today.

It is an ideal place to know Javanese culture, enjoy the traditional dance and gamelan.

In addition, a visitor can know the brave Sultan‚Äôs contribution in 1825-1830, and also can learn the importance role Yogyakarta played in struggling for the independence of Indonesia.

The entrance fee is just nominal, only 10k.

Everywhere is worth seeing, everyone behaves with courtesy.

Thanks Sultan‚Äôs family for providing us visitor such a good opportunity to have a good time in this palace in Yogyakarta.üòäüôè"
1,Y M,9 months ago,5 stars,"I guess this place is one of the top want-to-visit sites in your list in Yogyakarta. Little bit too wide to look around thoroughly but you can feel quietness and coolness inside.

It's almost like an open-air park. I don't know whether it's really worth visiting for all, but only if you have a bit or more of curiosity on Indonesian culture, maybe it's worth spending some time on it and tick the list.

Some places are not allowed to even enter, but it seems okay to enter into because it is just open. As a result, a staff runs to me and gets very angry in Indonesian language. You'd better show a warning sign in English!

If you want to take some photos, it costs you Rp. 1000.

There is an official guide you can hire for free, but mine was non-English speaker. If an English-speaking guide, my experience was more exciting?"
2,C R,6 months ago,5 stars,"We came here on Sunday, so many people there. But we enjoyed it. Great historical place to visit, love the ambience. Recommend to bring your kids here, so they can learn the culture."
3,Peony Ang,2 months ago,5 stars,"Amazing palace and culture that they displayed out.

Great place to experience the Javanese culture, enjoy the traditional dance and gamelan. Do come early! We reached at 10am and they performance just started. Recommended to stay throughout!

The entrance fee is around 10k for foreigners.

It is nice that the Sultan and his family allows locals and foreigners to have a good opportunity to be able to immerse into the Javanese culture! üíñ"
4,Maulana Ahsan Fahmi,11 months ago,5 stars,"The palace is divided into closed and opened areas for the public. In the opened area, we can enjoy the buildings, vehicles, clothes, equipments used by the palace in ancient times. If you're lucky, you can meet ""abdi dalem"" and see art performances by local performers"
5,Desi Oktavianika,a year ago,5 stars,"Very great museum! Must visit if you are in Yogyakarta and looking for museum or history place. I visited The Palace of Yogyakarta for three times. The complex is a center of javanese culture, and contains a museum displaying royal artifacts."
6,walkingtourbin,11 months ago,5 stars,I came here almost in every Wednesday and Saturday to see puppet show. On Sunday to see traditional dance performance. Most of the time i came to bring my guest as a tour guide. As a visitor sometimes i came in here not in the weekend and just bring myself to understand more and study more from what i have learned. It is such a great place in the center of Yogyakarta to see place where Jogja's king live. This place just have a calm vibes and peaceful. The trees there and the servants who work in here they are so proud. The building designed was so nice.  It is a quite big palace actually because there are a lot to see and learn in this palace. So when you come here dont in rush or just for photo. But look and enjoy it the historical place as Jogja palace.
7,Nova Manik,2 weeks ago,5 stars,"An incredible place to visit to learn about the culture, the history, and Yogyakarta's Kraton.
The spots inside can be explored with or without a guide.
Place watch out on the caution line since some spots are prohibited to be stepped on.

You also can follow (at)kratonjogja(dot)event on Instagram to see art performances on its ""stage"".
Worth to watch!"
8,Claudia Brigita,8 months ago,5 stars,"Great place for cultural activities and historical of Yogyakarta king or sultan. Lots of stuff to see but be careful of people outside of the area like becak driver and local parking thug, they charge IDR 50k for useless becak trip and the local thug making chaos between them for parking area distribution, scare the sht out of my family."
9,Raidzwan Daeng,3 months ago,5 stars,"Its a place where jogja king work n stay before, alot of history of jogja king n empire can read here, the traditional jogja architecture and the king people dress in traditional costume look very beautiful.
HTM for WNA is IDR 15k"
10,Sheila Khalida Wildanum,4 months ago,5 stars,"This is one of cultural icon in jogja you must visit, they said you never have been to jogja if you never go to keraton palace. The palace is use as home for king of jogja and his family for generations. This is the last kingdom in Java island of Indonesia who has guarded their own royal blood until now. if you lucky enough. You will have a chance to see traditional gamelan song and traditional dance. There is also restaurant officially serve the royal cuisine near by."
11,Reynaldi Widianto,2 months ago,5 stars,There are a lot of local rules that need to be obeyed here. For example you can't use an umbrella inside the palace (outdoor). People are friendly. There was a show in the afternoon.
12,Merel Scheltema,a month ago,5 stars,Well worth a visit! Do not blindly trust people in front of the entrance when they tell you it is closed; this can be a trick. Beautiful place with nice 3 museum areas tucked away in houses without clear signing - so make sure to look around carefully if you are without a guide!
13,Michel te Dorsthorst,4 months ago,5 stars,Beautiful palace with a lot of history. Definately recommend visiting.
14,Shahril Affandi Radzali,3 years ago,5 stars,"A glimpse of old kingdom in Java island, this palace surely mesmerize every visitors with its architecture and historical value. It is a must visit place if you come to Jogjakarta for the first time. You can learn a lot about the history especially the royal family. Located at the center of the special region of Jogjakarta, it can be accessible from any corner of the palace. Please spend at least an evening to stroll around the palace complex as it worth your time. The complex provides guide to bring you to all the places. We are lucky to have a very friendly guide that is so resourceful about the palace history, the royal family and the history of the kingdom. Please check the visit time as the royal family is still living inside the palace. Its a visit you wont regret."
15,Hobi Gori,3 weeks ago,5 stars,"Great experience with traditional culture, we can feel the heritage and calm"
16,pilo im,a month ago,5 stars,Enjoyed better than expected.. with funny English guide. Good to know the secret of Indonesia‚Äôs royal family story and hidden history..  worth visiting!
17,Johanes Jenito,3 years ago,5 stars,"A very nice place to visit as tourist. Most of the Java knowledges are available by the current moment of the palace. This place is part of Indonesian history instead the others. As part of the current political power, the palace is take a place into govern as the official governor of Jogjakarta Province just like the other Province in this country. But, it has special autonomous to combine the very traditional political-historical manners & the modern day of democracy. So, when the visitors has coming, all of us could be understand on the role of this palace from the beginning to the latest situation"
18,Yustiana E,4 months ago,5 stars,"If you visit to Yogya, don't forget to see the Keraton of Yogyakarta and if Lucky you can see the performance of Keraton gamelan and dances ü•∞ ‚Ä¶"
19,Timoth√© Paris,3 years ago,5 stars,"Nice palace / museums.
Entrance is around 15k rupiah.

It's composed of multiples beautiful buildings and a few exhibits of old items and also explanations about the Sultan's life.

Don't believe people near the entrance saying it's closed at noon, it's obviously a lie."
20,Endang's Art Cave,4 years ago,5 stars,"Entering this palace complex is certainly bringing you immediately to Java long time ago. This complex is beautiful and it has a lot of collections to see for the visitors. This museum is unique because the king and queen are still staying here, yet public can see it openly like a normal museum. It is totally a must visit for tourists. Jogja is special because of this place ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
21,Fransiska Astuti,3 years ago,5 stars,"The Symbol of Yogyakarta City. As Yogyakarta Sultan's home , this palace known as the central of power of Yogyakarta. All the people of Yogyakarta will obey the Sultan's words. Even he is not an authoritarian person.

We were guided by one of Sultan's soldier (as a tour guide also in his free time). Clearly he  explained every parts of what  palace made off which represent symbols and deep meaning of how, why and when it was built. Each part has its own story. Very historical place.

Every part of house or hall at the palace has its own function at different occasion too.

Mannequins wearing beautiful Traditional clothes for different occasion each displayed at a showcase hall.
You can find also the first replica of Masjid Agung (the Great Mosque) of Yogyakarta.

At the entrance to the main hall of the throne, there are mannequins two executioners at the left and right side. But spot are no longer used.

Unfortunately, we didn't see the Golden Chariot. I think I'll redo this tour.

For the facilities such as rest room, souvenir store, information desk are provided. But no line for wheelchair."
22,Ridho Dwi Mardiyanto,a year ago,5 stars,The palace area of the Yogyakarta Palace which is open to the public. The entrance ticket for domestic is Rp. 7000 and international is Rp. 15000. The place holds a lot of history of the royal palace of Yogyakarta. Highly recommended for tourists visiting Yogyakarta.
23,Gerald Mamengko,3 years ago,5 stars,"during the December 2019 holiday yesterday, I visited the palace of Yogyakarta. I am very happy with cultural shows and cities that have a lot of art shows. what a coincidence I was with only 10 thousand rupiah (as a domestic tourist) all my curiosity about the Yogyakarta palace has been answered with some dance performances that happened to be that day!"
24,Fanny syariful alam,a year ago,5 stars,The classical landmark of Jogjakarta. Never change despite the city development and modernization. Traditional values remain still and somehow it is rather difficult to find this under the current massive development.
25,El Brayan Mero,a year ago,5 stars,Fascinating place with tremendous history. Loved the photographs and items from past Sultanates. Wonderful lady tour guide who was great.
26,Sahalas,a year ago,5 stars,"The palace still used by the Sultan but open for public. There is museum, mostly about Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX which I've read his biography. He was a humble king and the Indonesian patriot. Brought my kids here to learn about his patriotism."
27,Hazel Nadine,3 years ago,5 stars,"Because it is still a residence of the Sultan, we cannot see the entire palace complex. Entrance fee was very cheap even for foreigners whose entrance fee was a little higher. There is also a fee for taking pictures but don‚Äôt worry because it‚Äôs cheap. You can ask for an official guide when you enter and it‚Äôs very recommended to use a guide because you‚Äôll know the history and not just aimlessly wandering around the complex. There isn‚Äôt a fixed fee for the guide but just give them a reasonable tip.
The only downside was that the toilet was not so clean. Afterwards, the guide may ask whether you want to go to the Museum of Horse-Drawn Carriages near the palace (<300 m of walking). It‚Äôs an additional Rp5.000,00 if you want."
28,Aldarlingdear,10 months ago,5 stars,"Do not, I repeat, do not trust men who said  that the Keraton is full and direct you to ""that hall where the entrance fee is free"". Just smile and persist that you'd check it yourself. After the embarrassment of Borobudur (IDR 362.500 for non Indo, IDR 50k for Indo??? Idk if I'm going to recommend it to my expat friends) the visit to Keraton is a balm to our wound. The tour guide has so much knowledge, you can tell her devotion to the Sultan. Keraton is beautiful and a treasure trove for history. Go visit Keraton if you haven't!"
29,Yuninda Santhi Hendrian,a year ago,5 stars,"If you like historical place, you should go here. Price of the ticket entrance is Rp.8000. At the inside, there is a museum about the place it self and the generation Sultan of Yogyakarta."
30,ÁôΩÊùâ,8 months ago,5 stars,"There have transitional dance performance every weekend around 11:00, love this royal colors"
31,Aryeh Sternberg,4 years ago,5 stars,"An intriguing look into the unique history of the Sultan and history of the people of Yogyakarta. The Palace is a must-see if you are staying in the city and good couples with a trip to the Water Palace at the same time.

Be sure to explore the various corners and side areas as there are hidden mini museums everywhere."
32,Doni Laksono,7 months ago,5 stars,"This a national treasure, very authentic from the past era of Sultanate of Yogyakarta.

Even when it was crowded, I felt so comfortable to be here."
33,Naura Fadhilah Khairunnisa,4 months ago,5 stars,the palace is so beautiful and peace
34,An Aria,4 years ago,5 stars,"Beautiful place, the fee is roughly less than 10.000 rupiah. I paid 8.500 rupiah, with explanation of 7.500 rupiah for the entrance fee and 1.000 rupiah for photographing permit. Yea you have to buy it, because everyone will take pictures no? Anyhow, the place is great. I was there all alone and regretting why I don't realise that they offer tour guide programs for tourists. If only I had known I'll sign up for a short historical schooling on regard to the culture of this place. I heard that they will hold a Wayang performance  at 11 or something. But, when I went there it starts at approximately 10 am so you need to clarify that by asking one of the guide if you can."
35,kimberlly grace,10 months ago,5 stars,"IMPORTANT!!! The palace is closed at 2 pm. RECOMENDED to take Becak to explore the palace and some tourism spots around it. Only 25k rupiah, you get transportation for 2 people, a tour guide, and a photographer (the becak driver was very superb, he took nice photos). Tip your becak driver if you satisfy with their service. ü§† ‚Ä¶"
36,Agung Bowo Laksono,3 years ago,5 stars,"Have visited this place several times but I have never been bored, especially when you visit it with family and get a good local guide from the palace itself. The guide knows all the history of the palace, the symbols that is everywhere in the building and its meanings, and can describe how the king in the past act in running the kingdom. There are performances daily, check Google on performance schedules, all are free"
37,Arini Zulfa,a month ago,5 stars,Beautiful place with good guide ‚ù§Ô∏è
38,Faza Fawzan Bastarianto,3 years ago,5 stars,Really love this place as a museum for living monarch in this modern era. This palace complex also contains a museum displaying royal artefacts and performs traditional Javanese dances in particular days.
39,Agus Wiwanto,5 months ago,5 stars,"You need to come here to know further about Jogja. The entrance fee is cheap and you can pay the guide fee as you want (please give them properly) but you definitely need a guide. They have vast knowledge and will happily answer your questions. You will lost half the experience of the visit if you do not have any guide.
The palace is big and its surrounding lands are owned by the Sultan. You will can go up to the third level of inner palace (there are seven area that represent the seven levels of the world according to Javanese).
There are a lot of memorabilia from the previous Sultan and the current Sultan. The previous Sultan is a Indonesia's National Hero who support the Indonesia's independence (which also give Jogja as a special province status)"
40,Nur Anisah,4 years ago,5 stars,"‚Ä¢ The constructions is very artistic and valuable.

43,"Moch Faisal Karim, PhD",3 months ago,5 stars,"As a history enthusiast, I feel like this palace could have explained more about Javanese history. At this very moment, it was very much limited in terms of content and things being shown. Need to improve on the content."
44,Gita Indriani Syafitri,3 years ago,5 stars,Cultural trip with kids here is fun. You can watch traditional dance every Thursday and Sunday. The explanation of the guide is very clear.
45,naufal faiz,3 years ago,5 stars,"The palace is rich in historical value in a city that is also historic. If you need an explanation of every place in the palace, there are also many guides that provide services to take us. If you visit Jogja, you must visit here"
46,Emiel Allefs,4 years ago,5 stars,"Its a nice palace of the sultans. The local guides know like everything about the sultans, the palace, and things around them. There are still a lot of ceremonies and artifacts. Also, there is live shadowplaying.

They have old documents written in javanese language. All the Sultans old cars and carriage. Very nice! After you left the palace. They will guide you to Batik where you can get nice paintings. The guy from the painting store is rly nice. He speak good englische and not force you to buy. He explains a lot.
48,dhimas baskoro,4 years ago,5 stars,"The site is a witness of the history. The pride of Jogjakarta citizen. The buildings are old, some renovation might required. But maybe dont.

51,Joglowebs. Com,4 years ago,5 stars,"Walking along the palace which still functioned as the residence of the king and his family until now will be a pleasant and full of knowledge. The Yogyakarta Palace Complex is divided into two parts, namely the part that can be visited by tourists as well as the closed part because it is the center of the royal family's activities. Some parts that visitors should not enter include Gedhong Jene (a place to welcome royal guests), Gedhong Purworetno (Sultan's office as the King of Yogyakarta), Kencana Ward, Trajumas Ward, and Kaputren. Even so, you don't need to worry, there are many other parts that you can visit and explore.

In addition to the magnificent buildings in the form of a pavilion or also called a ward, you can visit the museum of historical objects in the Yogyakarta Palace. There is a collection of tableware gifts from relatives, various batik fabrics along with the history of their making, a collection of chairs from Sri Sultan HB VIII and the empress, and a collection of paintings. One painting that should not be missed is the self-portrait of Sri Sultan HB VI by the maestro Raden Saleh.

Stepping to the end, you will find a building that describes in full the information, documentation, and memorabilia of Sri Sultan HB IX. In this building, there are various clothes such as official royal clothing, clothes that are worn when supitan. Riding and soccer clothes, Pandu uniforms, work desks, service badges, diplomas, to the old collection of cameras belonging to the Sultan."

Cameras were being charged only for Rp 1,000/ camera or phone camera. All retribution will go for the palace staff wages and palace maintenance. Please book a tour guide as you'll understand more about the history. They're are not setting fixed price for the fee, it's voluntarily for their welfare. They'll happily tell you all the information you need no matter your tip."

One of the amazing story is that even in that open wide area, if you clap your hand inside this keraton, that sound will vibrating and heard from the outside area. It is said that when King (Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono) need his people, he only need to clap, and his people will hear and come."

75,Natasha Angeline,4 years ago,5 stars,"One of my British friends said, the palace makes me think that the king is on budget. I must admit, it is not the most grand, vivacious kind of a palace, but it has its own aesthetic. The dance, the costumes, the fact that lots of the palace's attendees are only paid a bare minimum, which aren't enough for their day-to-day living, but they still want to serve their leader."
76,Desy Prima,4 years ago,5 stars,"An historical palace that we can learn alot about Yogyakarta.  Besides the building,  we will get alot information from the museum,  diorama,  and the manekins.

82,Charulata,5 months ago,5 stars,"The Palace and Museum are ok, entrance rp15k per person. Museum has some nice pieces and photos but no explanations in English.  Guides are available to show you around and cost a donation of your choice. Best thing is the 10am performance of a story from the Ramayan.  Performed under cover, by professional musicians and artistic dancers, traditional style, no dialogue, colourful costumes and a wonder to see.  Not to be missed and costs much less that similar performances at Prambanan temple or Purawista.  Highly recommend a visit here just for the performance."
83,Richo Wirawan,5 years ago,5 stars,"The most royal complex I've ever visited. This is the complex that preserve the legacy of Sultans and their family - consists of many buildings which serve their own respective functions. The ticket is cheap & there is an additional charge for photo/video permit (which is super cheap, again). Abdi Dalem (the term for people who serve Keraton and all its rules) are guarding most of this palace's area. Not all areas are accessible for the tourists. IMPORTANT : sleeveless are not allowed (for men) but shorts are allowed."
84,Miquel Louis Setiadi,5 months ago,5 stars,"Keraton Yogyakarta was built in 1756 by Prince Mangkubumi. The palace building stretches from north to south. On the north front side, you can find the square, also called ""Plaza North,"" and in the backyard, it is called ""Southern Square.""

The inner keraton is the center of the compound and is decorated with beautiful ornaments and teak wood structures in its interior.

There is a special room for royal weddings and the inauguration of princes and princesses. The most important area in the inner palace is Bangsal Prabayeksa, a hall where sacred weapons are kept. There are keris, spears, knives, arrows, war uniforms, and guns.

Keraton Yogyakarta is open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and costs 15,000 rupiah to enter."
85,Stewart,4 months ago,5 stars,Very good place in Yogyakarta. I love the decor there. Highly recommended. Historical place for the Royal family of that region.

It is the seat of the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and his family. The complex is a center of Javanese culture, and contains a museum displaying royal artifacts. It is guarded by the Yogyakarta Kraton Guards (Indonesian: Prajurit Keraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat).
The complex was built in 1755‚Äì1756 (AJ 1682) for Hamengkubuwono I, the first Sultan of Yogyakarta.[1] It was one of the monarch's first acts after the signing of the Treaty of Giyanti, which recognized the creation of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta under the Dutch East India Company.[1] A banyan forest, protected from flooding by its location between two rivers, was chosen as the site for the palace.[1]

On 20 June 1812, Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to attack the walled royal city of Yogyakarta. Although they outnumbered the British, the Javanese were unprepared for the attack. Yogyakarta fell in one day, and the palace was sacked and burned. A total of ¬£15,000 in gold, jewels and currency (currently valued at ¬£500,000) was looted. It was the first attack on a Javanese court, and the sultanate was subjugated to colonial authority.[2] Most of the current palace was built by Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII (who reigned from 1921 to 1939), and was rebuilt after earthquakes in 1876 and 2006."

In addition to increasing knowledge about Javanese culture, we can see heritage objects belonging to the palace and the royal family. One of them is a vehicle.
The palace displays several golden chariots and cars used by the king for various purposes. It is better if a visit to the palace is accompanied by a tour guide in order to get a more detailed explanation about the palace and its unique history."

256,Aditya Priambudi,2 years ago,5 stars,"The only fully functioning Javanesse Royal Palace left in the whole country.

I won't go into a history lessons, since you can probably find it from various sources. Although please do keep in mind that this place is not just a tourist spot, or any other places in that matter. The Kraton is a FULLY FUNCTIONING Royal Palace with a Monarch residing within her. Thus, please, keep your etiquette while coming inside The Kraton and wear the proper attire which suits the place. Don't just walk in with a hot pants or any other kind of suits in similar type.

Do respect the place and The Monarch whom residing within it since The Yogyakartans really loves Him. They may not sound a protest, since their culture kind of hinder them to say something negative directly towards the corresponding individual, but believe me, they don't like it.

For the place itself, it's certainly is one of a kind experience to do if you take a complete tour of The Royal Palace. I repeat, a complete tour. Wether you choose to do it with or without the guide provided there, since it will cost a bit more. Because the main attraction, at least for me, is when you come to the complex behind Pagelaran (The Front Lobby), since it's the place where they hold the traditional Royal dance and music. Plus, they now have a lot of vendors outside Alun-Alun Utara (The North Plaza) to hang out, so it certainly wouldn't bore you."

303,Fajar M. Darmawan,3 years ago,5 stars,"The complex was built in 1755‚Äì1756 (AJ 1682) for Hamengkubuwono I, the first Sultan of Yogyakarta. It was one of the monarch's first acts after the signing of the Treaty of Giyanti, which recognized the creation of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta under the Dutch East India Company.[1] A banyan forest, protected from flooding by its location between two rivers, was chosen as the site for the palace.
On 20 June 1812, Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to attack the walled royal city of Yogyakarta. Although they outnumbered the British, the Javanese were unprepared for the attack. Yogyakarta fell in one day, and the palace was sacked and burned. A total of ¬£15,000 in gold, jewels and currency (currently valued at ¬£500,000) was looted. It was the first attack on a Javanese court, and the sultanate was subjugated to colonial authority. Most of the current palace was built by Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII (who reigned from 1921 to 1939), and was rebuilt after earthquakes in 1876 and 2006."
